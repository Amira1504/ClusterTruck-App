ClusterTruck is a project to reduce air pollution and carbon emissions in residential areas. This will be achieved by allowing residents to form groups to share deliveries of goods ordered online via this application.

Transport was the largest contributor to UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2017. UK air pollution leads to an “associated loss of life across the population of 340,000 years”. If separate deliveries could be reduced to just one shared drop-off for each neighbourhood, traffic and pollution would be greatly reduced.

The actual exchange of goods from courier to residents could be organised in different ways.
The neighbourhood could nominate one resident to receive all deliveries and then other residents could pick up these items (presumably on foot) at some pre-agreed time. Maybe this ‘main’ resident could receive some kind of perk (e.g. vouchers or discounts). This would also facilitate social interaction within the community.

Alternatively, all residents could receive deliveries to their homes, but at some common and pre-agreed time, so that couriers can serve a neighbourhood in one trip .

In either case, neighbourhoods could benefit from reduced road traffic and air pollution.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
